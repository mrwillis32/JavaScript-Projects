    var blues = "It ain't easy being green.";
    var blues = blues.fontcolor("purple");
    document.write(blues);
    // here the variable "blues" is equal to " it aint easy being green." In the second line var blues = blues.fontcolor("purple") is letting us know that the variable now also represents a color and that color is purple. therefore when the document.write() function is used not only will the stateent "It ain't easy being green." be printed out on screen but it will also print out in purple.

    let myAge = 62;
    document.write("I am " + myAge + " years old.");
    //I am 62 years old will be printed on screen. the let myAge varriable is equal to 62. In the document.write function I combined the string "I am" + the let var of myAge + years old to reach my outcome.
